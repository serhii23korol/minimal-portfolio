# Functional Requirements and Notes

**Basic Idea**: A two-page website with a main page displaying your name, position, location, rotating skills, and a link to another page where more information about yourself is presented.

**Steps to Implement**:

1. **Main Page**: Display your name, position, and rotating skills, as well as a text link that navigates to another page with more details about you.

2. **Additional Info Page**: Create a second page with more detailed information about your background, hobbies, and professional experience.

3. **Navigation**: Add a clickable link on the main page that directs users to the second page.

4. **Theme Switcher**: Include the theme switcher on both pages to toggle between light and dark modes.

5. **Styling**: Use consistent CSS styling across both pages for a cohesive look.
